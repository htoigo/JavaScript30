# Taking the JavaScript30 Challenge

This is my implementation of the JavaScript30 Challenge, a challenge to build 30
things in 30 days using only plain vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML, no
frameworks, libraries or other third-party code allowed! JavaScript30 was
created by Wes Bos and published online for free. You can take the challenge
yourself at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com). If you are a
new frontend developer or want to brush up your Javascript skills, I recommend
going through the course.

The original starter files and completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge
are available on [github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).
